# ReceiptAPI
Receipt API using Express and pdfkit

I made this for non profit contribution receipts. My understanding Stripe's receipts is not as customizable to add statments to fufill IRS requirements.

Obviously this is done with a post request, and in production would just use import natively without exposing information over an API. This is more so practicing and using pdfkit.
